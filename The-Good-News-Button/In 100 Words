The Good News Box is a household beacon that uses IoT to encourage and celebrate 
face-to-face conversations that share important announcements by sending notifications 
to your household when interacted with. 

With no context given to these notifications and only a time given to meet at the object 
to receive the news, the product aims to build suspense and gather the household in one
place and build excitement at receiving this news - who is reaching for the box? Who
has good news they need to share?
