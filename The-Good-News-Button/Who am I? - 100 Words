My design background stems from studying interaction design at undergraduate level, 
therefore I was fairly familiar with using arduino and processing albeit very rusty to begin with. 
This is definitely where my strengths lie in this module in making my technology for this project work. 

Whereas my weakness for this module is my physical model making - I would not really consider myself a maker 
but that is part of the reason why I’m studying product design for my masters as I’m looking to expand my toolkit 
to include being a competent maker.

I also took more of a risk with my video that I normally would - I opted for a rougher shot video to fit the 
rough nature of my prototype.
